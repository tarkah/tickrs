# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The sections should follow the order `Packaging`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`
and `Removed`.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- API data is only fetched for widgets that are actively shown
  - This greatly reduces the number of active API requests when many tickers are
    added. Data is lazily fetched & updated once a widget is in view ([#118])

## [0.14.2] - 2021-03-05

### Fixed

- Fix bug preventing Index tickers from working ([#115])

## [0.14.1] - 2021-03-02

### Fixed

- Fixed keybind to correctly capture <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd> in the
  chart configuration pane ([#110])

### Changed

- UI changes so that wording is consistent throughout ([#112])
  - Stock symbols show as uppercase in tabs section
  - Letters for stock information are now capitalized
  - Words in Options pane are now capitalized
  - Toggle box shows the current chart type rather than the next chart type

## [0.14.0] - 2021-02-26

### Added

- Kagi charts have been added! ([#93])
  - You can specify custom reversal type (pct or amount), reversal value, and
    price type (close or high_low) within the GUI by pressing 'e'
  - New config options have been added to configure the behavior of Kagi charts,
    see the updated [wiki entry](https://github.com/tarkah/tickrs/wiki/Config-file)
  - As Kagi charts x-axis is decoupled from time, the chart width may be wider than
    the terminal. You can now press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd><</kbd> / <kbd>></kbd>
    or <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>LEFT</kbd> / <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> to scroll the chart.
    An indicator in the bottom right corner will notify you if you can scroll further
    left / right
  - `--candle` has been deprecated in favor of `--chart-type`

### Packaging

  8MB ([#86])

- Fixed last x label for candlestick charts from showing unix time 0 for 1W - 5Y
  timeframes ([#85])

## [0.13.0] - 2021-02-19

### Added

- Candestick chart support has been added. You can press 'c' to toggle between
  line and candlestick charts ([#75])

    in the config file to launch with candlestick charting enabled

  the theme config ([#76])

## [0.11.0] - 2021-02-12

### Added

- Summary pane can be scrolled with Up / Down arrows if more tickers are present
  than are able to be shown in the terminal ([#63])
- A config file can now be used to change program behavior. A default file will
  be created / can be updated at the following locations ([#66])
